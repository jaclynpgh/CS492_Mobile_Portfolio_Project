## Scenario
Your client, Matthew Peter, is the owner of TwentySix Cafe, a Portland coffee shop.

"Man, I am so tired of these wasted bagels and pastries we have at the end of every day!" he says. "I'm losing money, and it's so wasteful... I feel like there's an episode of Portlandia about this. I mean, why waste a donut? A donut!"

Mr. Peter wants his employees to run an application that, "is like Instagram, but for food waste," he says. Every night the person closing the shop can gather up the leftover baked goods, take out their phone, start the app, and create a post consisting of a photo of the wasted food and the number of leftover items.

"If only I could see a list of these posts over time, then at least I'd know how much money I'm losing, and I could make adjustments to my pastry orders," he says, dreamily. "No more forsaken donuts!"

You have engaged Matthew Peter in a paid contract to develop a functioning version of the application that he and his employees can try out at the coffee shop. "Hey, I know," he says, "Let's call it Wasteagram."
